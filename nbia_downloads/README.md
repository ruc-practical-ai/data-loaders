# Downloads Location

This is the location where downloaded datasets will be stored.

It is a shared folder with the host machine to allow downloaded data to persist between sessions.

As long as the host machine's corresponding folder remains intact, Dev Containers for this repository can be stopped and started and downloaded data will not be lost.
