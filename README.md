# Data Loading Tools

This repository holds tools for loading datasets to be used in RUC's Practical AI class.

## Installation and Usage via Codespaces or a Devcontainer (Recommended)

### Installation via Codespaces (Recommended)

To use this repository via codespaces simply click on the `code` &rarr; `codespaces` &rarr; `create codespace on main` buttons.

Once the codespace is open in the browser, click the three bars in the top left corner and select `Open in VS Code Desktop`.

Widgets might work better when using VS Code Desktop vs. in the browser.

Note the codespace might take a long time to build. This is usually due to TexLive dependencies. Use `Cmd` / `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` &rarr; `Codespaces: View Creation Logs` to check status.

If required, use `Cmd` / `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` &rarr; `Codespaces: Rebuild Container` to rebuild the container. Do not use `gh codespace rebuild`. This takes a long time since it re-downloads the entire image.

### Installation via a Devcontainer

To install via a locally hosted devcontainer, confirm your machine has a local devcontainer compatible environment (e.g., confirm you have Docker Desktop and Windows Subsystem Linux if running on Windows). Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruc-practical-ai/data-loaders.git
cd data-loaders
```

Navigate to the repository directory and open it in VS Code.

```bash
code .
```

VS Code should prompt you to open in a devcontainer. If it does not or if the container does not build, use the command `Cmd` / `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` &rarr; `Devcontainers: Rebuild Container`

## Local Installation and Use (Not Recommended)

### Dependencies for Local Installation

It is recommended to use this repository via codespaces or in a locally hosted devcontainer. If attempting to install locally, the following dependencies are required.

#### NBIA Data Retriever

Some tools in this repository use Python to generate datasets or download basic machine learning datasets. Other tools access data from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) using the National Biomedical Imaging Archives (NBIA) Data Retriever.

The NBIA Data Retriever command line interface is required to run some scripts in this repository. Installation and usage instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/NBIA/NBIA+Data+Retriever+Command-Line+Interface+Guide).

#### Expect

Scripts in this repository require the [expect](https://linux.die.net/man/1/expect) linux utility. Some scripts require expect to work. Install expect using the preferred method for your system.

#### Reveal.js

This project uses [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) for some presentations in the `presentations` folder. All reveal.js dependencies are included in the repository. The repository itself is a modified [basic setup](https://revealjs.com/installation/#basic-setup) of reveal.js.

#### Poetry

This project is built on Python 3.12. Poetry is required for installation. To install Poetry, view the instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

In codespaces, Poetry installation is handled in the development container. The user does not need to install Poetry if working in codespaces.

#### TexLive

This project also requires TexLive to render math fonts. Texlive can be installed via the following commands.

```bash
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install texlive
sudo apt-get -y install dvipng texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended cm-super
```

In codespaces, TexLive installation is also handled in the development container. The user does not need to install these packages if working in codespaces.

### Local Installation

#### Project Cloning

To install locally, first install the required dependencies (Poetry and TexLive), then clone the repository and navigate to its directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruc-practical-ai/data-loaders.git
cd data-loaders
```

#### Installing Python Dependencies Locally

To install locally, first install the required dependencies (Poetry and TexLive), then clone the repository and navigate to its directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruc-practical-ai/data-loaders.git
cd data-loaders
```

Configure Poetry to install its virtual environment inside the repository directory.

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

Install the repository's Python dependencies.

```bash
poetry install
```

Check where Poetry built the virtual environment with the following command.

```bash
poetry env info --path
```

Open the command pallette with `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` and type `Python: Select Interpreter`.

Now specify that VSCode should use the that interpreter (the one in `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe`). Once you specify this, Jupyter notebooks should show the project's interpreter as an option when you click the `kernel` icon or the small icon showing the current version of python (e.g., `Python 3.12.1`) and then click `Select Another Kernel`, and finally click `Python Environments...`.

## About the Datasets

### Fundamental Datasets

The `pydatasets` package contains educational code to generate several basic machine learning datasets.

### Online Datasets - Python

The `pydatasets` package also contains code to access several machine learning datasets hosted online, intended for educational and research purposes.

### Online Datasets - The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)

TCIA is an online service which hosts a large archive of medical images of cancer accessible for public download. More information about TCIA can be found on its main webpage, [https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/):

> "The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) is a service which de-identifies and hosts a large publicly available archive of medical images of cancer.  TCIA is funded by the Cancer Imaging Program (CIP), a part of the United States  National Cancer Institute (NCI), and is managed by the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR). The imaging data are organized as “collections” defined by a common disease (e.g. lung cancer), image modality or type (MRI, CT, digital histopathology, etc) or research focus. DICOM is the primary file format used by TCIA for radiology imaging.   An emphasis is made to provide supporting data related to the images such as patient outcomes, treatment details, genomics and expert analyses."

TCIA encourages researchers to publish results obtained on the TCIA collections. See [https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/about-the-cancer-imaging-archive-tcia/](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/about-the-cancer-imaging-archive-tcia/) for additional information.

#### Browse TCIA Collections

You can browse the datasets hosted on TCIA here: [https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/browse-collections/](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/browse-collections/).

#### The National Biomedical Imaging Archive (NBIA) Data Retriever

The NBIA Data Retriever is used to download data from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). More information on the NBIA Data Retriever can be found [here](https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/NBIA).

The NBIA Data Retriever requires a manifest file which specifies which data it should download from TCIA before performing a download.

Manifest files ensure data downloads are repeatable. This repository contains several manifest files in the `nbia_manifest/` directory.

The NBIA Data Retriever has both a command line and a graphical user interface. The tools in `pydatasets` abstract this away however, and users of these tools should not need to interact with the NBIA interface.

For those who do need to interact directly with the NBIA Data Retriever, more information can be found on its CLI [here](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/NBIA/NBIA+Data+Retriever+Command-Line+Interface+Guide).

#### TCIA User Guide

Complete instructions on interacting with TCIA can be found in the [user guide](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/NBIA/TCIA+Radiology+Portal+User%27s+Guide).

#### Producing a New Manifest File

The manifest files are produced by browsing the online [TCIA search tool](https://nbia.cancerimagingarchive.net/nbia-search/).

If a manifest file needed is not found, follow the steps below to produce one.

1. Navigate to the TCIA search tool in a web browser: [https://nbia.cancerimagingarchive.net/nbia-search/](https://nbia.cancerimagingarchive.net/nbia-search/).
2. Select the datasets of interest on the sidebar.
3. Add the data products of interest to the shopping cart.
4. Navigate to the `Cart` tab and click `Download`.
5. This will produce a manifest file in your `Downloads` folder (or your browser's default location).
6. Move the manifest file into your development environment (e.g., make a new folder in the `nbia_manifest_files` directory and put the file there).

Once you have placed a manifest file here, the data loader tools can use it to download images from TCIA.

## License

This repository is provided with an MIT license. See the `LICENSE` file.

Datasets downloaded with the NBIA Data Retriever will include a license file with the dataset in the `nbia_downloads` folder. These licenses may come with extra constraints per dataset that must be adhered to.

## Contributing
